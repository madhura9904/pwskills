    "\n",
    "- **Training multiple decision trees** on different bootstrapped samples of the data.\n",
    "- **Averaging (regression)** or **voting (classification)** their predictions.\n",
    "- This **cancels out the noise** from any single tree, smoothing the prediction.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Bagging mainly **reduces variance**.\n",
    "- So it works **best with high-variance, low-bias models** like decision trees.\n",

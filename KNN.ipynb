    "### **Q1. What is Bayes' Theorem?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' Theorem is a mathematical formula used for determining the **conditional probability** of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. It helps us **update our beliefs** based on new evidence.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Q2. What is the formula for Bayes' Theorem?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( P(A|B) \\) is the **posterior probability**: probability of A given B is true.\n",
    "- \\( P(B|A) \\) is the **likelihood**: probability of B given A is true.\n",
    "- \\( P(A) \\) is the **prior probability** of A.\n",
    "- \\( P(B) \\) is the **marginal probability** of B.\n",

    "\n",
    "Bayes’ Theorem is used in many fields:\n",
    "- **Spam detection** (classifying emails as spam or not)\n",
    "- **Medical diagnosis** (updating disease probability given symptoms)\n",
    "- **Machine learning** (especially in Naive Bayes classifiers)\n",
    "- **Risk assessment** (updating risk levels based on new data)\n",

    "\n",
    "So, check your data distribution. If you have word frequencies → use **Multinomial**. If binary flags (like presence/absence) → use **Bernoulli**. If continuous features → use **Gaussian**.\n",

1)STATISTICS:Science of collecting,organizing,analying data to help in decision making process

2)Types of stats:
1)Descriptive stats:Consist of organizing and summarising data.Ex:Surveys
2)Inferential Stats:Consist of using data you have measured to draw conc using tests like z-test,t-test,hypothesis testing,p-value.Ex:In companies to draw inferences

3)Types of data:
1)Quantitative:Numerical data(+,/,*,-)
1]Discrete-It will be whole no with a specific range-Ex:No of bank acc,No of children
2]Continous-Any val;dec ad any range-Ex:Height,weight,speed,temp

2)Qualitative/Categorical:
1]Nominal:Fixed categories-Ex:Blood group,genders
2]Ordinal:We assign Rank to those categories-Ex:Reviews-Good,bad,satisfactory

4)(i)Qualitative-Ordinal
  (ii)Qualitative-Nominal
  (iii)Quantitaive-Continous
  (iv)Quantitative-Discrete

5)Scale of measurment of data:
1)Nominal scale data:
>Qualitative data is ivolved
>Ex:Gender,color
>Order doesn't matter
>Focus more on count/distribution

2)Ordinal scale data:
>Ranking,order matters
>Diff can't be measured
>Ex:Qualification

3)Interval scale data:
>Rank and order matters
>Difference can be easily measured excluding ratio
>Don't have 0 starting value-may even start with negative values
>Ex:Temperature


4)Ratio scale data:
>Order,rank matters
>Differences are Measurable along with ratios
>Does have a 0 starting point
>Ex:Grades

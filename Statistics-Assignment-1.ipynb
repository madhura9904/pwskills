    "1)STATISTICS:Science of collecting,organizing,analying data to help in decision making process\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Types of stats:\n",
    "1)Descriptive stats:Consist of organizing and summarising data.Ex:Surveys\n",
    "2)Inferential Stats:Consist of using data you have measured to draw conc using tests like z-test,t-test,hypothesis testing,p-value.Ex:In companies to draw inferences\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Types of data:\n",
    "1)Quantitative:Numerical data(+,/,*,-)\n",
    "1]Discrete-It will be whole no with a specific range-Ex:No of bank acc,No of children\n",
    "2]Continous-Any val;dec ad any range-Ex:Height,weight,speed,temp\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Qualitative/Categorical:\n",
    "1]Nominal:Fixed categories-Ex:Blood group,genders\n",
    "2]Ordinal:We assign Rank to those categories-Ex:Reviews-Good,bad,satisfactory\n",

    "5)Scale of measurment of data:\n",
    "1)Nominal scale data:\n",
    ">Qualitative data is ivolved\n",
    ">Ex:Gender,color\n",
    ">Order doesn't matter\n",
    ">Focus more on count/distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Ordinal scale data:\n",
    ">Ranking,order matters\n",
    ">Diff can't be measured\n",
    ">Ex:Qualification\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Interval scale data:\n",
    ">Rank and order matters\n",
    ">Difference can be easily measured excluding ratio\n",
    ">Don't have 0 starting value-may even start with negative values\n",
    ">Ex:Temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Ratio scale data:\n",
    ">Order,rank matters\n",
    ">Differences are Measurable along with ratios\n",
    ">Does have a 0 starting point\n",
    ">Ex:Grades\n",
    "\n",
    "6)For easy and efficient collection and organizing of data\n",
    "Ex:Ordinal scale when used to analyze qualifications of people can help us arrive easily at the best candiddate.\n",
    "\n",
    "7)        NOMINAL                         ORDINAL\n",
    "    Order/Rank don't ,matter        Order/Rank matter\n",
    "    Ex:Place of origin              Ex:Qualification\n",

    "10)Measure of central tendency:\n",
    "Mean:Describes the average of data\n",
    "Median:Gives the mid-value of data\n",
    "Mode:Gives us the most frequented value\n",
    "\n",
    "Measure of dispersion:\n",
    "Variance:The spread of numbers\n",

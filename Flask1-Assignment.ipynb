    "Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is lightweight, flexible, and easy to use, making it ideal for small to medium-sized web applications. Flask is referred to as a \"micro\" framework because it does not include many built-in tools or libraries, allowing developers to pick and choose the components they need for their project.\n",
